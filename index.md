# Introductory remarks

## What is this?

This website is a two-parts curriculum aimed to help beginners self-study mathematics. The first part discusses core mathematical subjects that most undergraduate mathematics student will see in some way or another. The second part is a series of electives that can be studied more independently, concluding with a few applications to different fields outside of mathematics.

## What is required to do this?

 We assume a modest mathematical background, mostly high school mathematics. The most important thing to have is patience. Learning mathematics takes a very long time, and you will get stuck over and over and over and over again.

## Who is this for?

Anyone with an interest in mathematics, provided they fit the requirements above.

## How should I study mathematics?

Do as many exercises and problems as you can. Mathematics is mostly an exercise-based game. Most of your time should be spent solving stuff. If you don't like problem-solving, you probably won't like mathematics very much.

Practically speaking, I suggest reading through the section you are working on quickly, and then trying your hand at the first few exercises. If you get immediately stuck, re-read the theory and the proofs in it. What techniques are being used? How are these techniques applied to the problem? Can I use that same technique to solve my exercise? If not, could I modify it to suit the task at hand?

Do not be too quick to look up the solution to the exercise. You learn most when you are stuck for a certain amount of time trying to figure out all possible paths to the solution. At most, ask for a hint. Take your time. It's a marathon, play the long game.
