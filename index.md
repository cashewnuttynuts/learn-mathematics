# Introductory remarks

## What is this?

This website is a two-parts curriculum aimed to help beginners self-study mathematics. The first part discusses core mathematical subjects that most undergraduate mathematics student will see in some way or another. The second part is a series of electives that can be studied more independently, concluding with a few applications to different fields outside of mathematics.

## What is required to do this?

 We assume a modest mathematical background, mostly high school mathematics. The most important thing to have is patience. Learning mathematics takes a very long time, and you will get stuck over and over and over and over again.

## Who is this for?

Anyone with an interest in mathematics, provided they fit the requirements above.

## How should I study mathematics?

Do as many exercises and problems as you can. Mathematics is mostly an exercise-based game. Most of your time should be spent solving stuff. If you don't like problem-solving, you probably won't like mathematics very much.

Practically speaking, I suggest reading through the section you are working on quickly, and then trying your hand at the first few exercises. If you get immediately stuck, re-read the theory and the proofs in it. What techniques are being used? How are these techniques applied to the problem? Can I use that same technique to solve my exercise? If not, could I modify it to suit the task at hand?

Do not be too quick to look up the solution to the exercise. You learn most when you are stuck for a certain amount of time trying to figure out all possible paths to the solution. At most, ask for a hint. Take your time. It's a marathon, play the long game.

# Part I: Core Subjects

This part deals with common subjects found in most undergraduate mathematics degree. There isn't really any subject here I would skip, all of them are important in helping you acquire mathematical maturity, as well as a general understanding of the various basic structures in mathematics.

## Discovering the basics

This section is mostly concerned with revisiting things you should have seen in high school, as well as strengthening your mathematical dexterity by introducing proofs into the mix. Even at this level, we can find [conjectures that seem hopelessly difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) or that have [evaded mathematicians for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_conjecture). Mathematics is by nature a pyramide of knowledge, everything builds from the basics, so spend adequate time to study them properly.

### Learning and metacognition

Learning how to learn is very important and something that is rarely discussed outright. I suggest following [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn?). Alternatively, read the book:

**[A Mind for Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X)**, *Barbara Oakley*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/oakley.jpg" alt="Oakley" width="200px"/>

The book [Good Habits, Bad Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Habits-Bad-Science-Positive/dp/1250159075) is a great way to learn about creating habits. I suggest you make learning mathematics a part of your daily routine, if you're serious about learning it. Another good idea would be to read this:

**[How to Think Like a Mathematician](https://www.amazon.com/How-Think-Like-Mathematician-Undergraduate/dp/052171978X/)**, *Steve Houston*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/houston.jpg" alt="Houston" width="200px"/>

### Precalculus

Precalculus deals with high school subjects before calculus is introduced. This means functions, (in)equations, analytic geometry, trigonometry and sometimes matrices as well as limits. There are a myriad of books you can use for this, and I suggest you find one you like. Here is my favorite:

**[Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell](https://www.amazon.com/Precalculus-Mathematics-Nutshell-Geometry-Trigonometry/dp/1592441300/)**, *George F. Simmons*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/simmons.jpg" alt="Simmons" width="200px"/>

The book is short, so do everything in there. Another option is to read Lang's precalculus book, although if you do use it, be sure to look for an errata online because I remember it having quite a few mistakes and typos. It's what you might call "old school", from one of the greatest math textbook writer of all time, part of the influential [Bourbaki group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki).

**[Basic Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Mathematics-Serge-Lang/dp/0387967877)**, *Serge Lang*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/lang-basic_mathematics.jpg" alt="Basic Mathematics" width="200px"/>

Make sure you are extremely comfortable with algebra and trigonometry before moving on. 

### Calculus

Calculus deals with infinity in a computational manner, you learn to take derivatives and integrals as you try to understand how to relate the infinitesimally small with the infinitely large. We will come back to these questions in a deeper way in the [real analysis section](#real-analysis), but this subsection is concerned more with the application of these tools to solve problems such as optimizing functions and finding volumes of revolution. My favorite book happens to have a "pay what you want" model:

**[APEX Calculus](https://leanpub.com/apexcalculus)**, *Gregory Hartman*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/apex.png" alt="APEX" width="400px"/>

I suggest you do every chapter in the book, keeping in mind that this will take you a large amount of times. There are many, many exercises and you probably shouldn't do every single one of them before moving on. When you feel like you've understood the concept well enough, and you've done enough drills then go to the next section. There is another absolutely fantastic book series that I can't help but recommend, although it is pretty old by now, but to me it is still the gold standard for calculus:

**[Differential and Integral Calculus, Vol. 1-2](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Integral-Calculus-Vol-1-ebook/dp/B08S74TL87/)**, *Nikolai S. Piskunov*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/piskunov.jpg" alt="Piskunov" width="200px"/>

This book is written in the Soviet style of mathematics: it is terse, with examples taken largely from physics (especially classical mechanics) and decently hard exercises. If that sounds appealing to you, go with that one. Better yet, use both!

### Proof Techniques

In this section, we take some time to learn basic proof patterns and how they are used in mathematics to make sure we are correct in our arguments. Proofs are not the end all be all of mathematics, but rigor is necessary to avoid nonsense as [19th century mathematics proved time and time again](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-23715-2). I like this free book:

**[Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)**, *Richard Hammack*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/hammack.jpg" alt="Hammack" width="200px"/>

You should do everything here. Do notice chapter 13 will be revisited in the real analysis section, but it's not a bad idea to see it here first.

## Building foundations

In this section, we now move on to actual mathematics major classes. If you have done everything in the past section, you are now ready for it. That doesn't mean it will be easy, however. There is a definitely a jump in difficulty here, and it is normal. The good news is that it will probably the hardest jump you'll have to clear.

### Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is the heart and soul of mathematics. In practically every field, our first instinct is to linearize problems and see if we can retrieve the original solution from it. It is central to everything that will follow and for this reason you need to be extremely proficient with it. Thankfully, the linear algebra textbooks that follow are of very good quality and my top recommendation is entirely free:

**[Linear Algebra Done Wrong](https://www.math.brown.edu/streil/papers/LADW/LADW.html)**, *Sergei Treil*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/ladw.png" alt="LADW" width="200px"/>

This book is just great. Don't be fooled by the cheeky name (probably a reference to the next book), this textbook is wonderful, with a great spread of exercises ranging from simple verification to more involved problems. I suggest doing everything in there. Another good text is the following classic:

**[Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/3031410254/)**, *Sheldon Axler*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/ladr.jpg" alt="LADR" width="200px"/>

The "Done Right" comes from the author's opinion that determinants tend to muddy up understanding of linear algebra among first year students who then go on to learn things the "wrong" way. I am not sure I agree all that much, but at least the textbook is consistent and well-written. I would use this one to supplement Linear Algebra Done Wrong and as a source of more exercises. There is one more book I recommend if you have never seen matrices before. This book is much simpler than either of the other two recommended textbooks and I'd get it if you feel like you're completely lost. I have only worked with the 4th and 5th editions, so I would suggest getting these:


**[Linear Algebra and its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-Global/dp/1292351217/)**, *David C. Lay, et al*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/lay.jpg" alt="Lay" width="200px"/>

### Real Analysis

And now the subject that strikes fear in many undergraduate students: real analysis. This is the subject where you will truly have to wrestle with the definitions, propositions and proofs. Studying analysis requires a change of mindset and the acquisition of new tools that often confuse the beginning mathematician. For this reason, I offer you three main options, a complimentary counterexample book as well as a sort of study guide. The first book is perhaps my favorite mathematics textbook of all time:

**[Understanding Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Analysis-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00XWDQUH4/)**, *Stephen Abbott*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/abbott.jpg" alt="Abbott" width="200px"/>

This is the book that made me fall in love with mathematics. Abbott is a master didactician and his introduction of analysis is thoroughly motivated, his style is clear and precise but is surprisingly gentle. I actually suggest you look at both the first and the second edition if you can, because they have different discussions to introduce the chapters. Perhaps the only issue with the text is I wish it'd have more really hard exercises to grind your teeth against. The next book fills that niche by having you construct most of the theory yourself:

**[Analysis I](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Third-Texts-Readings-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B01LFAANIW/)**, *Terence Tao*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/tao.webp" alt="Tao" width="200px"/>

What to say about Terence Tao that hasn't already been said. Everyone always mentions [his famous blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) and of course his many mathematical contributions. A Fields medalist, not only is he a master at mathematics, he's a master at mathematics writing and this text is a perfect example. It is definitely not easy as you are required to do a lot of the thinking behind the theory itself, but it is worth doing for precisely that reason. The power you get from constructing the course yourself is very exhilarating. With that said, I can't help but recommend one more book by Lang, this one slightly lesser known but still very good (I especially liked the discussion on potentials):

**[Undergraduate Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Undergraduate-Analysis-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387948414)**, *Serge Lang*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/lang-undergrad_analysis.jpg" alt="Undergraduate Analysis" width="200px"/>

For this one, I suggest you do the main sequence Lang proposes and then pick two-three special topics that interest you and study those. All three of these books focus on building examples to help you understand the theory, but counterexamples are just as important, even more so in analysis. This is where the following book helps:

**[Counterexamples in Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Counterexamples-Analysis-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486428753/)**, *Bernard R. Gelbaum, John M.H. Olmsted*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/counterexamples_analysis.jpg" alt="Counterexamples Analysis" width="200px"/>

I suggest you look at the counterexamples that interest you personally, instead of just reading through the book linearly. The next book aims to prepare and help you work through analysis:

**[How to Think about Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Think-About-Analysis-Lara-Alcock-ebook/dp/B00O94K6NO/)**, *Lara Alcock*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/alcock.jpg" alt="Alcock" width="200px"/>

### Discrete Mathematics

This section is concerned with so-called "discrete mathematics", which here would be basic combinatorics (including induction) and mostly graph theory. This kind of mathematics is especially useful for computer science, and one of my favorite textbook on the subject is written by Donald Knuth, one of the most legendary programmers of all times. Regardless, a good introduction to the subject is this book:

**[Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen-ebook/dp/B07FF9DY66/)**, *Kenneth H. Rosen*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/rosen-dm.jpg" alt="Rosen DM" width="200px"/>

If you are especially interested in computer science or programming, then it's hard to beat this one:

**[Concrete Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Mathematics-Foundation-Computer-Science-ebook/dp/B08F5H9DYM/)**, *Ronald Graham, et al*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/concrete.jpg" alt="Cocnrete" width="200px"/>

Finally, here's a funny book that uses ducks to introduce discrete mathematics:

**[Discrete Mathematics with Ducks](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Ducks-Textbooks-dp-1138052590/dp/1138052590/)**, *sarah-marie belcastro*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/duck.jpg" alt="Ducks" width="200px"/>

It is a bit easier than the others but the instruction quality is very good nonetheless.

### Basic Number Theory

We now move to the *Queen of Mathematics*, as Gauss used to say. Basic number theory is a subject that tends to be dismantled and studied in different parts of mathematics. But number theory is too beautiful to be dismembered so, and I think it is crucial to study it to better understand further examples in higher mathematics, notably in abstract algebra. The following book is well suited to introducing the elementary parts of the theory, those that do not use analysis or abstract algebra:

**[Elementary Number Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Number-Theory-Its-Application/dp/0321500318/)**, *Kenneth H. Rosen*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/rosen-nt.jpg" alt="Rosen NT" width="200px"/>

Another classic, albeit slightly dated, is this wonderful book:

**[An Introduction to Theory of Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Numbers-G-Hardy/dp/0199219869/)**, *G. H. Hardy, E. M. Wright*


<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/hardy.jpg" alt="Hardy" width="200px"/>

I would suggest exploring the book, rather than outright studying it. Walk through the various chapters lightly, stopping where your interest takes you, and studying there.

## Mastering the fundamentals

We now move to the core of a mathematics undergraduate degree. This is where abstraction and generalization is taken to another level. These courses are absolutely crucial to understanding modern mathematics, and all of these theories were developped to help mathematicians solve important problems. For instance, much of modern algebra was developped to solve [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem). Ordinary Differential Equations and Classical Differential Geometry grew, in part, out of physics. Topology is a natural extension of real analysis and helps transfer its tools to other fields. 

The selection of these four topics is somewhat arbitrary, for instance, Fourier analysis has a central place in modern analysis and could have been here. Similarly, Galois theory is central to abstract algebra, although it is rarely covered early on in mathematics textbook. The interested student is invited to study both of these early on, but they will be listed in [Analysis](#analysis) and [Algebra](#algebra) respectively.

### Ordinary Differential Equations

Most of physics is described by differential equations, and it is a very mature and rich theory. Yet unlike some of the more abstract subjects, differential equations has a practical nature, and many differential equations are not solved exactly but through numerical methods. This makes for an interesting topic, that can be approached from multiple angles. Personally, my favorite way to introduce differential equations is the way this book presents it:

**[Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Equations-Applications-Historical-Mathematics/dp/1032477148/)**, *George F. Simmons*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/simmons-ode.jpg" alt="Simmons ODE" width="200px"/>

If you would like a presentation style closer to Russian-style books, with a focus on rigor and structure, then the following textbook might interest you:

**[Differential Equations](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Equations-Springer-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/3319452606/)**, *Viorel Barbu*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/barbu.jpg" alt="Barbu" width="200px"/>

### Classical Differential Geometry

Classical Differential Geometry takes the tools of calculus and uses them to go further than analytic geometry, and introduce notions of speed, acceleration and curvature in geometry. This is interesting in many ways. For one, you actually use the tools you constructed in your previous analysis classes to do something with them, and this is where you first see the full power of calculus and why it was revolutionary. I studied the subject using the following book:

**[Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Geometry-Surfaces-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/3319397982/)**, *Kristopher Tapp*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/tapp.jpg" alt="Tapp" width="200px"/>

Another interesting book that recently got reprinted is the classic by Kobayashi:

**[Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Geometry-Surfaces-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/981151738X/)**, *Shoshichi Kobayashi*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/kobayashi.jpg" alt="Kobayashi" width="200px"/>

In the same vein, the gold standard for classical differential geometry is the book by Do Carmo:

**[Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Geometry-Curves-Surfaces-Mathematics/dp/0486806995/)**, *Manfredo P. Do Carmo*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/docarmo.jpg" alt="Do Carmo" width="200px"/>

This is probably the book that is used most for a single-semester undergraduate differential geometry class. I like it, it's great.

### Abstract Algebra

Abstract algebra, usually called simply algebra is a language used to describe the concept of equations and all possible generalizations of it, such as equivalence relationships and the like. Many parts of mathematics have an algebraic counterpart: algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, even algebraic analysis. As such, it is paramount that you get familiar with it. My favorite textbook on the subject is free:

**[Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/aata.html)**, *Thomas W. Judson*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/aata.png" alt="AATA" width="200px"/>

The book is great and is available in French and Spanish. My only issue with the book is that the exercises are often too simple, and I suggest finding other exercises elsewhere. One possible book for this is the following books:

**[Algebra I, Gorodentsev](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-I-Textbook-Students-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B01NACZUA4/)**, *Alexey L. Gorodentsev*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/gorodentsev.jpg" alt="Gorodentsev I" width="200px"/>

This is the first out of two textbooks (written in the Russian style) that form one gigantic course in algebra, covering way more than a generic abstract algebra undergraduate course. I would suggest starting with the first book, and if you like its style and presentation, consider doing the second one. Personally, it has some of my favorite exposition but it is not as gentle as Judson. One highlight is covering quaternions and spinors, which I barely ever see in undergraduate mathematics textbook. Another textbook that discusses interesting topics that are not always given enough time at the undergraduate level is this masterpiece:

**[Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-2nd-Michael-Artin/dp/0132413779/)**, *Michael Artin*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/artin.jpg" alt="Artin" width="200px"/>

This is the book I used along with Judson to learn algebra. One interesting point is that Artin makes heavy use of linear algebraic notions and examples to explore abstract algebra, a wise choice in my opinion. Finally, here is the obligatory Lang reference:

**[Undergraduate Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/Undergraduate-Algebra-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387220259/)**, *Serge Lang*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/lang-undergrad_algebra.jpg" alt="Undergraduate Algebra" width="200px"/>

I particularly liked the chapter on rings.

### General Topology

General Topology (sometimes called Point-Set Topology) is a generalization of the concepts of analysis (convergence, compactness and the likes) that can be applied in many different fields, usually yielding a rich theory. What happens when the space we are working with is so weird that it is hard to even define a distance on it? Can we deform space? In what way? This is the essence of topology. There are a few books I like, but this one is cheap and clear, especially the chapter on metric spaces:

**[Introduction to Topology](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Topology-Second-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486406806/)**, *Theodore W. Gamelin, Robert Everist Greene*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/greene.jpg" alt="Greene" width="200px"/>

I would recommend doing the entire chapter on metric spaces, with all the exercises. Metric spaces are in nmy opinion the most important examples in basic topology, and a large portion of the theory is dedicated to when a metric can be put on a space. After this, I would do the following book instead:

**[Topology](https://www.amazon.com/Topology-Classic-Classics-Advanced-Mathematics/dp/0134689518/)**, *James R. Munkres*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/munkres.jpg" alt="Munkres" width="200px"/>

This book is the classic undergraduate textbook on topology. It is a bit rough, but it has good explanations. If you liked classical differential geometry and you already know you want to know more about it, I would skip Munkres and I would do this instead:

**[Introduction to Topological Manifolds](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Topological-Manifolds-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/1441979395/)**, *John M. Lee*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/lee-top.jpg" alt="Top Mfds" width="200px"/>

This is the book I used to learn topology. Do not be scared by the fact it is supposed to be a graduate-level textbook, it is very approachable. Instead of discussing topology in full, absolute generality, the author (my favorite math author might I add) focuses on manifolds, the basic geometric object of interest.

# Part II: Electives

In this part, we gives a few potential electives an undergraduate mathematics student might take. Most of these are graduate-level, but if you have done the previous part, you are more than prepared for graduate-level classes. Sadly, this is also where my biases will start to show, I can only talk about things I have seen myself. There are many, many topics I do not know about or have never studied (especially at a graduate-level). In turn, some topics I have studied deeper (like algebraic geometry and symplectic topology) will have more references and topics covered. If you are interested in subjects not covered here, it doesn't mean I don't like them or I do not consider them important, it is simply that I have not personally had the chance to study them yet.

## Analysis

If you have liked undergraduate analysis topics such as calculus, real analysis and differential equations, this is for you. At the very least, I would expect most undergraduate students to take Fourier, complex and functional analysis, even if you don't plan on becoming an analyst. Fourier analysis is the heart of analysis, complex analysis is the perfect example of beauty in mathematics and functional analysis bridges the gap between analysis and algebra. Measure theory and probability rounds up what I would call the "core analysis graduate" sequence, and yes I consider probability to be a part of analysis, at least at the early graduate level. Other interesting subjects include dynamical systems (what I'd call the geometry of differential equations), harmonic analysis (Fourier on steroids), partial differential equations (the backbone of physics) and stochastic processes (a rich theory with many applications). Ok, let's get into it.

### Fourier Analysis

Fourier analysis is the genesis of much of what you have studied in real analysis. The convergence of Fourier series motivated both real analysis and measure theory. I believe every undergraduate student in mathematics, physics and engineering should have a class on Fourier series. For this, my favorite book is the first part of the four-part analysis series by Stein and Shakarchi:

**[Fourier Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Fourier-Analysis-Introduction-Princeton-Lectures/dp/069111384X/)**, *Elias M. Stein, Rami Shakarchi*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/stein-fourier.jpg" alt="Stein & Shakarchi, Vol.1" width="200px"/>

This book is absolutely stunning (as are all the books in the series, and I suggest using them to study graduate analysis). The exemples are motivated well and the exercises are just right. Honestly, there are other books in Fourier analysis but this one is the only one I used and I don't really know of others. I saw Körner has one, so maybe try that if you want a different view of the subject?

### Complex Analysis

Complex analysis is pure beauty. Everything you hated about real analysis seems to magically disappear when we enter the complex realm: differentiable implies analytic, the zeros of a complex function are defined in a beautiful pattern, etc. This doesn't mean the subject is easy however, as the theory is pretty unique in the way it handles computation, for instance contour integrals. As above, my favorite book on the subject is the second-part of Stein & Shakarchi:

**[Complex Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-Analysis-Princeton-Lectures-No/dp/0691113858/)**, *Elias M. Stein, Rami Shakarchi*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/stein-complex.jpg" alt="Stein & Shakarchi, Vol.2" width="200px"/>

A very lucid introduction to the topic, I like the selection of exercises and the presentation. Unlike Fourier analysis however, there are other good books on the subject. Another one that is more accessible is this one:

**[Complex Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-Analysis-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/1441972870/)**, *Joseph Bak, Donald J. Newman*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/bak.jpg" alt="Bak" width="200px"/>

There is one more very interesting book on complex analysis. As the name implies, the book takes a more geometrical approach:

**[Visual Complex Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Complex-Analysis-25th-Anniversary/dp/0192868926/)**, *Tristan Needham*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/needham.jpg" alt="Needham" width="200px"/>

I think all three books are interesting and give different perspectives, so try all three if you can.

### Measure Theory and Integration

We finally come back to real analysis, but this time through a more mature lens. We go back to the notion of integral we developped in the first textbooks we saw, and we refine it to make it both more general and more powerful. This is also where we take a look back on probability, and see why I put it as part of analysis. I will give two recommendations that discuss measure theory on its own, and two recommendations that tackle probability as well.

**[Real Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Analysis-Integration-Princeton-Lectures/dp/0691113866/)**, *Elias M. Stein, Rami Shakarchi*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/stein-real.jpg" alt="Stein & Shakarchi Vol.3" width="200px"/>

Yes, yes, what can I say? What a surprise. But once again, this book is gold. There is a reason why all the books in the series form the core of my recommendations for graduate analysis: they're just that good. This book is interesting because while it does focus on measures and integration, it also revisits previous topics from Fourier and complex analysis. It also has an interesting discussion of fractals. The exercises are splendid, with a great range of difficulty. Another great exposition is of course:

**[An Introduction to Measure Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Measure-Graduate-Studies-Mathematics/dp/1470466406/)**, *Terence Tao*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/tao-graduate.jpg" alt="Tao Graduate" width="200px"/>

As we have said before, Tao is great at writing mathematics and it shows. Also for some reason the AMS graduate textbooks just feel comfortable to me in a strange way I can't really describe. Anyway, it's good, try it out. Now on to books that discuss measure theory motivated mostly by probability:

**[Measures, Integrals and Martingales](https://www.amazon.com/Measures-Integrals-Martingales-Ren%C3%A9-Schilling/dp/1316620247/)**, *René L. Schilling*

I really like this book, it's how I personally learnt measure theory. If it is a bit tough, you can try this one out first, which is simpler:

**[Measure, Integral and Probability](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-Integral-Probability-Marek-Capinski/dp/1852337818/)**, *Marek Capiński, Ekkehard Kopp*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/mip.jpg" alt="MIP" width="200px"/>

### Functional Analysis

Now onto my favorite part of analysis. Functional analysis takes a closer look at functions, and to be more specific, *functionals*. This is the part of analysis that takes linear algebra and asks what happens when the basis becomes infinite. The question is more subtle than it seems, because infinity implies convergence and convergence implies topology. Still, it is in my opinion the coolest part of analysis (my algebraist bias shows here) and I think every mathematics enthusiast should study it. Naturally, it's hard to avoid the obvious choice:

**[Functional Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Analysis-Introduction-Princeton-Lectures/dp/0691113874/)**, *Elias M. Stein, Rami Shakarchi*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/stein-functional.jpg" alt="Stein & Shakarchi, Vol.4" width="200px"/>

Believe it or not, this is not the book I used to learn functional analysis. I learned functional analysis. Instead, I used the following book:

**[Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Functional-Analysis-Applications-Kreyszig/dp/0471504599/)**, *Erwin Kreyszig*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/kreyszig.jpg" alt="Kreyszig" width="200px"/>

This is a classic for a reason. The exposition is great and very gentle, you don't need much to learn with it. In fact, I took a class using this book when I was in my undergrad and the hardest requirement was basic topology. Another book that I really liked is this one:

**[Functional Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Analysis-Peter-D-Lax/dp/0471556041/)**, *Peter D. Lax*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/lax.jpg" alt="Lax" width="200px"/>

This is perhaps the coolest textbook of the bunch because it includes very cool sections on stuff that you rarely see in introductory functional analysis textbooks. It's harder than Kreyszig though. Also, the chapters are very short.

### Probability and Stochastics

You have perhaps already encountered probability at the graduate level depending on your choice of measure theory textbook. In this section, I give textbooks that focus mostly on graduate probability and where measure theory is either assumed or in an appendix or something. If the book is too difficult, try looking at one of the measure theory textbooks that discuss probability as well.

**[Foundations of Modern Probability](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-61871-1)**, *Olav Kallenberg*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/kallenberg.webp" alt="Kallenberg" width="200px"/>

This gigantic book (now re-edited by Springer in two volumes) is my favorite book on graduate probability, but it is huge. Do not expect to read this in a few weeks, this will take months and months to go through. On the flipside, it is exceptionally clear and I find it outstanding. If you want something smaller, this classic is worth it:

**[Probability](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics-v/dp/0387945490/)**, *A. N. Shiryaev*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/shiryaev.jpg" alt="Shiryaev" width="200px"/>

I love this book. It starts with intuitive probability and goes from there. It has this unmistakebly Russian flavor to it, but at the same time, it gives enough examples that you do not feel completely lost. If you're more interested in stochastic calculus specifically, this is a good reference:

**[Brownian Motion, Martingales and Stochastic Calculus](https://www.amazon.com/Brownian-Martingales-Stochastic-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/3319310887/)**, *Jean-François le Gall*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/shiryaev.jpg" alt="Shiryaev" width="200px"/>

Taking this suggestion a step further, this is the best book I know on stochastic differential equations:

**[Stochastic Differential Equations](https://www.amazon.com/Stochastic-Differential-Equations-Introduction-Applications/dp/3540047581/)**, *Bernt Oksendal*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/oksendal.jpg" alt="" width="200px"/>

### Harmonic Analysis

Okay, this section I do not know well as the only harmonic analysis I have looked at was some basics about the Fourier integral on LCA groups and a few keypoints about Tate's thesis. For this reason, I will only suggest one book: the one I used to learn some basic concepts.

**[Principles of Harmonic Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Harmonic-Analysis-Universitext-Deitmar-ebook/dp/B00PUM0HJM/)**, *Anton Deitmar, Siegfried Echterhoff*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/deitmar.jpg" alt="Deitmar" width="200px"/>

### Dynamical Systems

Dynamical systems is roughly the idea of studying differential equations through a geometric lens. It's a powerful tool and it has really cool applications, such as ecology and the like. There are two books I really like on the subject. The first one is this absolute classic:

**[Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems and an Introduction to Chaos](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Equations-Dynamical-Systems-Introduction/dp/0123820103/)**, *Morris W. Hirsch, et al*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/hirsch-smale.jpg" alt="Smale" width="200px"/>

This book was written in part by one of my favorite mathematician ever, Stephen Smale. The book is great, it covers a wide variety of topic at a level suitable for the subject. Great stuff. That being said, this wouldn't be my list if I didn't recommend V.I. Arnol'd:

**[Ordinary Differential Equations](https://link.springer.com/book/9783540345633)**, *Vladimir I. Arnol'd*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/arnold.jpg" alt="Arnold" width="200px"/>

### Partial Differential Equations

While we have seen ordinary differential equations in the first part, partial differential equations are another ball game entirely. For most of them, we have no idea how to solve them directly and we need either weak solutions or numerical methods. This is a subject I have only brushed so I cannot recommend a lot of different books, but I like this one:

**[Partial Differential Equations](https://www.amazon.com/Partial-Differential-Equations-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/1470469421/)**, *Lawrence C. Evans*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/evans.jpg" alt="Evans" width="200px"/>

There is another book I have seen before and I have used when I followed a seminar on graduate functional analysis:

**[Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Analysis-Differential-Equations-Universitext/dp/0387709134/)**, *Haim Brezis*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/brezis.jpg" alt="Brezis" width="200px"/>

What I like about it is that it mixes functional analysis and PDEs, two topics that are closely intertwined. Give it a try.
