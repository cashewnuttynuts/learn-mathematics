# Introductory remarks

## What is this?

This website is a two-parts curriculum aimed to help beginners self-study mathematics. The first part discusses core mathematical subjects that most undergraduate mathematics student will see in some way or another. The second part is a series of electives that can be studied more independently, concluding with a few applications to different fields outside of mathematics.

## What is required to do this?

 We assume a modest mathematical background, mostly high school mathematics. The most important thing to have is patience. Learning mathematics takes a very long time, and you will get stuck over and over and over and over again.

## Who is this for?

Anyone with an interest in mathematics, provided they fit the requirements above.

## How should I study mathematics?

Do as many exercises and problems as you can. Mathematics is mostly an exercise-based game. Most of your time should be spent solving stuff. If you don't like problem-solving, you probably won't like mathematics very much.

Practically speaking, I suggest reading through the section you are working on quickly, and then trying your hand at the first few exercises. If you get immediately stuck, re-read the theory and the proofs in it. What techniques are being used? How are these techniques applied to the problem? Can I use that same technique to solve my exercise? If not, could I modify it to suit the task at hand?

Do not be too quick to look up the solution to the exercise. You learn most when you are stuck for a certain amount of time trying to figure out all possible paths to the solution. At most, ask for a hint. Take your time. It's a marathon, play the long game.

# Part I: Core Subjects

This part deals with common subjects found in most undergraduate mathematics degree. There isn't really any subject here I would skip, all of them are important in helping you acquire mathematical maturity, as well as a general understanding of the various basic structures in mathematics.

## Discovering the basics

This section is mostly concerned with revisiting things you should have seen in high school, as well as strengthening your mathematical dexterity by introducing proofs into the mix. Even at this level, we can find [conjectures that seem hopelessly difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) or that have [evaded mathematicians for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_conjecture). Mathematics is by nature a pyramide of knowledge, everything builds from the basics, so spend adequate time to study them properly.

### Learning and metacognition

Learning how to learn is very important and something that is rarely discussed outright. I suggest following [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn?). Alternatively, read the book:

**[A Mind for Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X)**, *Barbara Oakley*

The book [Good Habits, Bad Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Habits-Bad-Science-Positive/dp/1250159075) is a great way to learn about creating habits. I suggest you make learning mathematics a part of your daily routine, if you're serious about learning it. Another good idea would be to read this:

**[How to Think Like a Mathematician](https://www.amazon.com/How-Think-Like-Mathematician-Undergraduate/dp/052171978X/)**, *Steve Houston*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/houston.jpg" alt="Houston" width="200px"/>

### Precalculus

Precalculus deals with high school subjects before calculus is introduced. This means functions, (in)equations, analytic geometry, trigonometry and sometimes matrices as well as limits. There are a myriad of books you can use for this, and I suggest you find one you like. Here is my favorite:

**[Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell](https://www.amazon.com/Precalculus-Mathematics-Nutshell-Geometry-Trigonometry/dp/1592441300/)**, *George F. Simmons*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/simmons.jpg" alt="Simmons" width="200px"/>

The book is short, so do everything in there. Another option is to read Lang's precalculus book, although if you do use it, be sure to look for an errata online because I remember it having quite a few mistakes and typos. It's what you might call "old school", from one of the greatest math textbook writer of all time, part of the influential [Bourbaki group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki).

**[Basic Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Mathematics-Serge-Lang/dp/0387967877)**, *Serge Lang*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/lang-basic_mathematics.jpg" alt="Basic Mathematics" width="200px"/>

Make sure you are extremely comfortable with algebra and trigonometry before moving on. 

### Calculus

Calculus deals with infinity in a computational manner, you learn to take derivatives and integrals as you try to understand how to relate the infinitesimally small with the infinitely large. We will come back to these questions in a deeper way in the [real analysis section](#real-analysis), but this subsection is concerned more with the application of these tools to solve problems such as optimizing functions and finding volumes of revolution. My favorite book happens to have a "pay what you want" model:

**[APEX Calculus](https://leanpub.com/apexcalculus)**, *Gregory Hartman*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/apex.jpg" alt="APEX" width="400px"/>

I suggest you do every chapter in the book, keeping in mind that this will take you a large amount of times. There are many, many exercises and you probably shouldn't do every single one of them before moving on. When you feel like you've understood the concept well enough, and you've done enough drills then go to the next section.

### Proof Techniques

In this section, we take some time to learn basic proof patterns and how they are used in mathematics to make sure we are correct in our arguments. Proofs are not the end all be all of mathematics, but rigor is necessary to avoid nonsense as [19th century mathematics proved time and time again](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-23715-2). I like this free book:

**[Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)**, *Richard Hammack*

<img src="/learn-mathematics/img/hammack.jpg" alt="Hammack" width="200px"/>

You should do everything here. Do notice chapter 13 will be revisited in the real analysis section, but it's not a bad idea to see it here first.

## Building foundations

In this section, we now move on to actual mathematics major classes. If you have done everything in the past section, you are now ready for it. That doesn't mean it will be easy, however. There is a definitely a jump in difficulty here, and it is normal. The good news is that it will probably the hardest jump you'll have to clear.
