# Introductory remarks

## What is this?

This website is a two-parts curriculum aimed to help beginners self-study mathematics. The first part discusses core mathematical subjects that most undergraduate mathematics student will see in some way or another. The second part is a series of electives that can be studied more independently, concluding with a few applications to different fields outside of mathematics.

## What is required to do this?

 We assume a modest mathematical background, mostly high school mathematics. The most important thing to have is patience. Learning mathematics takes a very long time, and you will get stuck over and over and over and over again.

## Who is this for?

Anyone with an interest in mathematics, provided they fit the requirements above.

## How should I study mathematics?

Do as many exercises and problems as you can. Mathematics is mostly an exercise-based game. Most of your time should be spent solving stuff. If you don't like problem-solving, you probably won't like mathematics very much.

Practically speaking, I suggest reading through the section you are working on quickly, and then trying your hand at the first few exercises. If you get immediately stuck, re-read the theory and the proofs in it. What techniques are being used? How are these techniques applied to the problem? Can I use that same technique to solve my exercise? If not, could I modify it to suit the task at hand?

Do not be too quick to look up the solution to the exercise. You learn most when you are stuck for a certain amount of time trying to figure out all possible paths to the solution. At most, ask for a hint. Take your time. It's a marathon, play the long game.

# Part I: Core Subjects

This part deals with common subjects found in most undergraduate mathematics degree. There isn't really any subject here I would skip, all of them are important in helping you acquire mathematical maturity, as well as a general understanding of the various basic structures in mathematics.

## Discovering the basics

This section is mostly concerned with revisiting things you should have seen in high school, as well as strengthening your mathematical dexterity by introducing proofs into the mix. Even at this level, we can find [conjectures that seem hopelessly difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) or that have [evaded mathematicians for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_conjecture). Mathematics is by nature a pyramide of knowledge, everything builds from the basics, so spend adequate time to study them properly.

### How to Learn

Learning how to learn is very important and something that is rarely discussed outright. I suggest following [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn?). The book [Good Habits, Bad Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Habits-Bad-Science-Positive/dp/1250159075) is a great way to learn about creating habits. I suggest you make learning mathematics a part of your daily routine, if you're serious about learning it.

### Precalculus

Precalculus deals with high school subjects before calculus is introduced. This means functions, (in)equations, analytic geometry, trigonometry and sometimes matrices as well as limits. There are a myriad of books you can use for this, and I suggest you find one you like. Here is my favorite:

**[Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell](https://www.amazon.com/Precalculus-Mathematics-Nutshell-Geometry-Trigonometry/dp/1592441300/)**, *George F. Simmons*

The book is short, so do everything in there. In general, make sure you are extremely comfortable with algebra and trigonometry before moving on.
